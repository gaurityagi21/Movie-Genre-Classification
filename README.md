# Movie Genre Classification

This project aims to classify movie plots into different genres using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing text data, training a Logistic Regression model on TF-IDF features, and evaluating the model's performance.

## Project Structure

- `genre_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of movie plots and their corresponding genres. Due to licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/movie-genre-classification.git
   cd movie-genre-classification
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Open `genre_classification.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. Use the trained model to classify new movie plots into genres.

## Model Evaluation

The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set. For detailed evaluation metrics and performance analysis, refer to `genre_classification.ipynb`.
